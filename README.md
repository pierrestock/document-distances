## Setup 

If you wish to use this code, you will have to install the following package:
```
pip install gensim 
```
The pretrained word2vec model is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit) (1.5 GB !)

You can take a look at the iPython Notebook __toy_examples.ipynb__ that contains a very brief description of the algorithm, some fun properties of the word2vec metric and studies the influence of some parameters on some toy examples. The toy data files are already in the __/data__ folder.  

## Playing around



## Going further

If you are interested in this topic, you can read the full pdf report (__/report__ folder) that details some theoretical aspects, the methodology and the experimental results on large datasets. A bibliography is included if you want to go deeper on the theoretical side.
